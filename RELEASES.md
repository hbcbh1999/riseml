# RiseML v1.0.0 (2017/12/19)

We are 1.0.0 finally. 

## Release Notes
- Re-worked storage integration with Kubernetes
- Quick installer for AWS
- Several fixes for better error reporting

## Upgrading from release candidates

Before upgrading:
- backup your existing data volumes
- make sure to prepare `data` and `output` Kubernetes volumes as described in our [documentation](http://docs.riseml.com/install/kubernetes.html#persistence)
- remove the options `data` and `output` from you installation configuration (usually `riseml-config.yml`)
- verify the configuration options in `riseml-config.yml` are still valid since they will be applied again (e.g., if you changed the account key to a different one it may be reset)

To update to the newest version, you can then run:
```
helm upgrade riseml-charts/riseml -f riseml-config.yml
```
If you need support with upgrading, please contact us.
