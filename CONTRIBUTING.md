# How to contribute to RiseML

## Bugs

Found a bug in a RiseML project? Here are some notes on how to report the bug so we
can fix it as fast as possible:

- Explain, as detailed as possible, how to reproduce the issue.
- Include what you expected to happen, as well as what actually happened.
- If it's a bug with a web app, please include information on what browser
  version and operating system you are running.
- If it helps, feel free to [attach a
  screenshot](https://github.com/blog/1347-issue-attachments) or video
  illustrating the issue.
- If you're having trouble with a specific build, please include a link to the
  build or job in question.
- Include all this information in a new issue on our [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/riseml/riseml/issues)

## Pull Requests

Know how to fix something? We love pull requests! Here's a quick guide:

1. [Check for open issues](https://github.com/riseml/riseml/issues), or
   open a fresh issue to start a discussion around a feature idea or a bug.
   Opening a separate issue to discuss the change is less important for smaller
   changes, as the discussion can be done in the pull request.
2. Fork the relevant repository on GitHub, and start making your changes.
3. Check out the README for the project for information specific to that
   repository.
3. Push the change (we recommend using a separate branch for your feature).
4. Open a pull request.
5. We try to merge and deploy changes as soon as possible, or at least leave
   some feedback, but if you haven't heard back from us after a couple of days,
   feel free to leave a comment on the pull request.
